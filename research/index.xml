## Overview

1. The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It&#39;s a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more

[![The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/main/starters/academic/preview.png)](https://wowchemy.com)

```python
print(&#34;Welcome to Academic!&#34;)
```

    Welcome to Academic!

## Install Python and JupyterLab

[Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) which includes Python 3 and JupyterLab.

Alternatively, install JupyterLab with `pip3 install jupyterlab`.

## Create or upload a Jupyter notebook

Run the following commands in your Terminal, substituting `&lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER&gt;` and `&lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE&gt;` with the file path to your Academic website folder and a short title for your blog post (use hyphens instead of spaces), respectively:

```bash
mkdir -p &lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER&gt;/content/post/&lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE&gt;/
cd &lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER&gt;/content/post/&lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE&gt;/
jupyter lab index.ipynb
```

The `jupyter` command above will launch the JupyterLab editor, allowing us to add Academic metadata and write the content.

## Edit your post metadata

The first cell of your Jupter notebook will contain your post metadata ([front matter](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/front-matter/)).

In Jupter, choose _Markdown_ as the type of the first cell and wrap your Academic metadata in three dashes, indicating that it is YAML front matter:

```
---
title: My post&#39;s title
date: 2019-09-01

# Put any other Academic metadata here...
---
```

Edit the metadata of your post, using the [documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content) as a guide to the available options.

To set a [featured image](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#featured-image), place an image named `featured` into your post&#39;s folder.

For other tips, such as using math, see the guide on [writing content with Academic](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/).

## Convert notebook to Markdown

```bash
jupyter nbconvert index.ipynb --to markdown --NbConvertApp.output_files_dir=.
```

## Example

This post was created with Jupyter. The orginal files can be found at https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite/content/post/jupyter --&gt;
