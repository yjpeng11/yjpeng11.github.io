Before taking this course, you are encouraged to have taken Abnormal Psychology, and Physiological Psychology. Additionally, students with some knowledge of counseling and therapy will have more to gain from this course, so it is also encouraged that you take Introduction to Counseling and Therapy.\nThe main objectives of this course are:\n(1) To learn and understand the knowledge related to psychopathology (diagnosis of psychological disorders, pathological mechanisms of various types of psychological disorders), to learn about the latest developments in psychopathology, and to be able to integrate clinical phenomena with psychopathological mechanisms to promote effective diagnosis of patients with psychological disorders and their understanding of the psychopathological mechanisms of their pathology; (2) On the basis of the previous course learning, to further possess or improve the skills of clinical questioning, assessment and diagnosis of common psychological disorders, and to be able to initially apply the theories learned to different clinical cases. As we encounter in the clinic, psychotherapy is a very complex process, and mastering it requires a long period of time, and this course will lay a solid foundation for you to enter the subsequent study of clinical psychology. I am very glad to start learning and exploring the mysteries of psychopathology with the students who take this course, and I also hope that the students who take this course can actively participate in the teaching and master the required knowledge and basic skills through teaching, literature reading and discussion, so that our teaching and learning can become an effective interactive relationship, and lay a good foundation for further study of psychotherapy in the future.\nSyllabus\nWeek 1 An Overview of Psychopathology: from categorical to dimensional approaches Week 2 Brain evolution, emotion regulation, and the vulnerability for emotional disorders Week 3 Brain, Experience and Destiny: Understanding psychopathology from the inter-generational biosocial-developmental model Week 4 Defining Characteristics of the Major Clinical/Psychological Disorders Week 5 Schizophrenia Week 6 Mood Disorders Week 7 Anxiety disorders Week 8 PTSD \u0026amp; OCD Week 9 Somatoform and Dissociative Disorders Week 10 Feeding and Eating Disorders Week 11 Sleep disorder Week 12 Gender Identity Disorders, Sexual Dysfunctions, and Paraphilia Week 13 Substance-use disorders and Addictive disorders Week 14 Understanding personality disorders Supplemental materials\nAdditional learning materials include videos of Psychiatric diagnosis made by our teaching assistant Hanyu Peng.

Interactions with strangers Objective: To test the validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the Social Anxiety Questionnaires-Adults (CSAQ-A).\nMethods: Totally 555 participants [aged 18 to 60 years, average age (29 ± 8) years old] were recruited to complete the CSAQ-A. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE) and several questionnaires related to anxiety and depression were conducted to test the criterion validity. After 4 weeks,143 subjects were retested.\nResults: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the five-dimensional structure of the CSAQ-A exhibited excellent fit indices. The CSAQ-A scores showed positive correlations with the LSAS, BFNE and other measurements of anxiety and depression (ICC=0.395-0.668, Ps\u0026lt;0.001). The internal consistency of the scale was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.96), and the test-retest reliability was acceptable (0.80).\nConclusion: The Chinese version of the Social Anxiety Questionnaire-Adults has good validity and reliability and can effectively evaluate social anxiety in the Chinese adult population.\nCitations:\n[1] 王愉茜，臧寅垠，彭玉佳. 中文版成人社交焦虑量表的信效度检验[J].

Children can acquire a new word after just a few passive exposures, a process known as fast mapping. This word learning capability is believed to be the most fundamental building block of multimodal understanding and reasoning. Despite recent advancements in multimodal learning, a systematic and rigorous evaluation is still missing for human-like word learning in machines. To fill in this gap, we introduce the MachinE Word Learning (MEWL) benchmark to assess how machines learn word meaning in grounded visual scenes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"MEWL：Few-shot multimodal word learning with referential uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujia Peng","Jeffrey D Knotts","Katherine S Young","Susan Y Bookheimer","Nusslock, Robin","Zinbarg, Richard E","Kelley, Nicholas J","Echiverri-Cohen, Aileen M","Craske, Michelle G"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"120556835e3b33c6436a765d2948701b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/2023_peng_bpcnni/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_peng_bpcnni/","section":"publication","summary":"TBD.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Threat neurocircuitry predicts the development of anxiety and depression symptoms in a longitudinal study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670889600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670889600,"objectID":"f2e5d93d808cf20833c6a13fd5fefb5e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/2022sad/","publishdate":"2022-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/2022sad/","section":"research","summary":"Human interaction with people and society is essential for a normal human life. Social anxiety disorder is an important subtype of anxiety disorders which manifests as extreme anxiety and avoidance of social behaviors and situations. Social anxiety has a high degree of comorbidity with depression and anxiety disorders, with patients showing abnormalities in emotional processing and social cognition, and is an effective entry point for analyzing the comorbidity and heterogeneity of depression and anxiety disorders. However, much remains unknown about the understanding of cognitive and brain mechanisms of social anxiety. We aim to combine psychophysics, eye-movement capture, brain imaging, and physiological signal recordings to investigate the processing specificity of social anxiety patients for emotional and social information in human actions. We aim to reveal individual differences  and construct predictive models of social anxiety symptoms. We also aim to explore combinations of different treatments and interventions to promote precise psychiatry.","tags":null,"title":"Emotion processing and intention inference in social anxiety disorder","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1639353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639353600,"objectID":"e7e4dbf64b277d445bc786d8e5611416","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/2021neurosubstrate/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/2021neurosubstrate/","section":"research","summary":"The field of psychiatry faces the dual challenges of heterogeneity and co-morbidity, in terms of mental disorder manifestation and pathological mechanisms.
