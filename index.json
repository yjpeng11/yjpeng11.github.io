Our research examines the order, disorder, and interconnections of cognitive, emotional, and social processing throughout the lifespan from childhood to older adulthood in healthy and diseased brains, to develop improved diagnostic and prognostic tests to be used in community mental health settings. Our current works aim to (1) understand negative cognitive bias in social anxiety, (2) decode individual differences in emotion and social perception based on multi-dimensional data, and (3) develop personalized neurofeedback treatments combined with classic psychological interventions to anxiety through computational neuroimaging methods.\n","date":1734566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1734566400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://yjpeng11.github.io/author/yujia-peng/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/yujia-peng/","section":"authors","summary":"The Depression and Anxiety Computational Neuroscience (DACN) lab is affiliated with the Department of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University, Beijing.

Previous research has indicated that major life events can greatly impact individuals’ mental health. However, due to the complexity and ambiguity nature of life events, shedding its light on social media data is quite challenging. In this paper, we are dedicated to uncovering life events mentioned in posts on social media. We hereby provide a carefully-annotated social media event dataset, PsyEvent, which encompasses 12 major life event categories that are likely to occur in everyday life. This dataset is human-annotated under iterative procedure and boasts a high level of quality. Furthermore, by applying the life events extracted from posts to downstream tasks such as early risk detection of depression and suicide risk prediction, we have observed a considerable improvement in performance.

The pictures were generated along three theoretical dimensions grounded in existing theories related to social anxiety:\n  Emotional Expression: Pictures depict emotional expressions categorized as negative, neutral, or positive.\n  Social Dominance: Pictures include scenarios with a dominant individual (i.e., one agent presenting a sense of being more important or stronger than other agents in the picture, or than the observer) or otherwise (e.g., peer-like relationships, or a single agent).\n  Eye Contact: Some pictures involve direct eye contact between characters and the observer, while others do not.\n  All pictures were uniformly resized to 1024×768 pixels to maintain consistency across the dataset.\nIn addition, SAIPS includes five subjective ratings: Social Anxiety Rating (SAR), Valence, Arousal, Involvement, and Picture-Text Consistency. These ratings offer a more comprehensive analysis of how images influence individuals’ psychological responses. The system also provides objective ratings, including image descriptions, scene characteristics, and the number of characters present, offering a multi-layered data set for research purposes.\nTo explore specific response patterns to social scenarios, SAIPS includes 118 control images without people, which help enhance the system’s accuracy in predicting social anxiety traits. SAIPS serves as a valuable resource for research on social anxiety, mental health, and the development of AI-based diagnostic and therapeutic tools.\nCitation: Ju, Q., Xu, Z., Chen, Z., Fan, J., Zhang, H., \u0026amp; Peng, Y.

The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE) and several questionnaires related to anxiety and depression were conducted to test the criterion validity. After 4 weeks,143 subjects were retested.\nResults: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the five-dimensional structure of the CSAQ-A exhibited excellent fit indices. The CSAQ-A scores showed positive correlations with the LSAS, BFNE and other measurements of anxiety and depression (ICC=0.395-0.668, Ps\u0026lt;0.001). The internal consistency of the scale was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.96), and the test-retest reliability was acceptable (0.80).\nConclusion: The Chinese version of the Social Anxiety Questionnaire-Adults has good validity and reliability and can effectively evaluate social anxiety in the Chinese adult population.\nCitations:\n[1] 王愉茜，臧寅垠，彭玉佳. 中文版成人社交焦虑量表的信效度检验[J].\n[2] Caballo VE, Salazar IC, Irurtia MJ, et al.

Despite recent advancements in multimodal learning, a systematic and rigorous evaluation is still missing for human-like word learning in machines. To fill in this gap, we introduce the MachinE Word Learning (MEWL) benchmark to assess how machines learn word meaning in grounded visual scenes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"MEWL：Few-shot multimodal word learning with referential uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujia Peng","Jeffrey D Knotts","Katherine S Young","Susan Y Bookheimer","Nusslock, Robin","Zinbarg, Richard E","Kelley, Nicholas J","Echiverri-Cohen, Aileen M","Craske, Michelle G"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"120556835e3b33c6436a765d2948701b","permalink":"https://yjpeng11.github.io/publication/2023_peng_bpcnni/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_peng_bpcnni/","section":"publication","summary":"TBD.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Threat neurocircuitry predicts the development of anxiety and depression symptoms in a longitudinal study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670889600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670889600,"objectID":"f2e5d93d808cf20833c6a13fd5fefb5e","permalink":"https://yjpeng11.github.io/research/2022sad/","publishdate":"2022-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/2022sad/","section":"research","summary":"Human interaction with people and society is essential for a normal human life. Social anxiety disorder is an important subtype of anxiety disorders which manifests as extreme anxiety and avoidance of social behaviors and situations. Social anxiety has a high degree of comorbidity with depression and anxiety disorders, with patients showing abnormalities in emotional processing and social cognition, and is an effective entry point for analyzing the comorbidity and heterogeneity of depression and anxiety disorders. However, much remains unknown about the understanding of cognitive and brain mechanisms of social anxiety. We aim to combine psychophysics, eye-movement capture, brain imaging, and physiological signal recordings to investigate the processing specificity of social anxiety patients for emotional and social information in human actions. We aim to reveal individual differences  and construct predictive models of social anxiety symptoms. We also aim to explore combinations of different treatments and interventions to promote precise psychiatry.","tags":null,"title":"Emotion processing and intention inference in social anxiety disorder","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://yjpeng11.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639353600,"objectID":"e7e4dbf64b277d445bc786d8e5611416","permalink":"https://yjpeng11.github.io/research/2021neurosubstrate/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/2021neurosubstrate/","section":"research","summary":"The field of psychiatry faces the dual challenges of heterogeneity and co-morbidity, in terms of mental disorder manifestation and pathological mechanisms.

It is widely recognized that the field has not yet established objective and effective diagnostic criteria and intervention and treatment programs.
