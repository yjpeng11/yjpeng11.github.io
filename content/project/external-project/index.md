summary: I received my PhD from the School of Psychology and Cognitive Science, Peking University. My research interest is to explore psychological cognitive intervention for anxiety and depression based on EEG neurofeedback. My research hopes to break through the limitations of traditional assessment and treatment methods, and explore the application of decoding neurofeedback in anxiety and depression. I hope to use a variety of research methods (e.g., EEG and other brain imaging, physiological signal recording, machine learning and computational modeling) to investigate the psychological and brain mechanisms of anxiety and depression, as well as the effectiveness of decoding neurofeedback therapy and the possibility of integrating it with traditional treatment methods.
