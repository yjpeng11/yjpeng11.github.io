title: Emotion processing and intention inference in social anxiety disorder
subtitle: Emotion vs. Intention in SAD.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Human interaction with people and society is essential for a normal human life. Social anxiety disorder is an important subtype of anxiety disorders which manifests as extreme anxiety and avoidance of social behaviors and situations. Social anxiety has a high degree of comorbidity with depression and anxiety disorders, with patients showing abnormalities in emotional processing and social cognition, and is an effective entry point for analyzing the comorbidity and heterogeneity of depression and anxiety disorders. However, much remains unknown about the understanding of cognitive and brain mechanisms of social anxiety. We aim to combine psychophysics, eye-movement capture, brain imaging, and physiological signal recordings to investigate the processing specificity of social anxiety patients for emotional and social information in human actions. We aim to reveal individual differences  and construct predictive models of social anxiety symptoms. We also aim to explore combinations of different treatments and interventions to promote precise psychiatry.
