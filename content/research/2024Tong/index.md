title: The Tong Test:Evaluating Artificial General Intelligence Through Dynamic Embodied Physical and Social Interaction

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: The release of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series has brought artificial general intelligence (AGI) to the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) field once again. However, the questions of how to define and evaluate AGI remain unclear. Our project proposes that the evaluation of AGI should be rooted in dynamic embodied physical and social interactions (DEPSI). More specifically, the Tong test proposes five critical characteristics to be considered as AGI benchmarks and suggests the Tong test as an AGI evaluation system. The Tong test describes a value- and ability-oriented testing system that delineates five levels of AGI milestones through a virtual environment with DEPSI, allowing for infinite task generation, and to promote standardized, quantitative, and objective benchmarks and evaluation of AGI.
