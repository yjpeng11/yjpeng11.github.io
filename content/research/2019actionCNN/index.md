title: The hierarchical representation of human actions and convolutional neural networks
summary: The human visual system can process external visual motion information quickly and efficiently, and obtain a series of understandings from low-level information (e.g. speed, texture) to high-level information (e.g. intention, goal). Action recognition is mediated by complex multi-stage processing of visual information emerging rapidly in a distributed network of cortical regions in the ventral and dorsal pathways. Previous evidence showed that image information and motion information are mainly processed in the ventral and dorsal visual pathways respectively. However, the complicated process remains poorly understood and is hard to be captured by computational models. With the development of deep learning and neural networks, computers have reached a height close to the human level in many visual tasks. But computers rely on a large amount of training data and strictly defined computational rules, which is not close to the highly efficient and adaptable human visual system. To investigate the representation of human actions in human brains and artificial neural networks, we are currently using fMRI and MEG to investigate the neural mechanisms behind action understanding and the correspondence between neural networks and human neural systems.
