abstract: "As a new way of implementing human-computer interface, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) dramatically change the user experiences and have broad applications in cyber behavior research. This methodological review attempts to provide an overall picture of the BCI science and its role in cyberpsychology. After an introduction of BCI and the literature search methods used in this review, we offer an overview of terms, history, components, methods and signals used in BCI. Different applications of BCI on both the clinical population and the healthy population are summarized in detail, with a conclusion of the future directions of BCI."
