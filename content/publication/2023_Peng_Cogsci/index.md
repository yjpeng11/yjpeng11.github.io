abstract: “Deep  convolutional  neural  networks  (DCNNs) have  been found  to demonstrate  hierarchical  mapping  to  human  brain regions  on  tasks  such  as  object  recognition.  However,  it remains unclear if such hierarchical mapping also applies to action recognition, which involves dynamic visual information processing. Here, we compared action representations of two-stream DCNNs to the human visual system. Five visual areas that  are  associated  with object  and action processing were selected. Nine human action  categorieswere adopted from three semantic classesto examine the action representations of both DCNNs and human visual areas. In two fMRI experiments, actions  were  presented  in the forms  of computer-rendered videos  and  point-light biological  motionvideos.Results showedthat although two-stream  DCNNs  demonstrated hierarchical representations of actions as layers grow deeper, DCNNslack  a  hierarchical  mapping  to  human  visual  areas. Consistently across different  video  displays and  DCNN pathways,  only  the  top  DCNN  layers  demonstrated highsimilarity to representations in the human visual system. The results  suggest  that the dynamic representations of human actions may be different in DCNNs compared to the humanvisual system, even after big-data training.”
