abstract: "As a new way of implementing human-computer interface, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) dramatically changed the user experiences and have broad applications in cyber behavior research. This chapter aims to provide an overall picture of the BCI science and its role in cyberpsychology. The chapter starts with an introduction of the concept, components, and the history and development of BCI. It is then followed by an overview of neuroimaging technologies and signals commonly used in BCI. Then, different applications of BCI on both the clinical population and the general population are summarized in connection with cyberpsychology. Specifically, applications include communication, rehabilitation, entertainments, learning, marketing, and authentication. The chapter concludes with the future directions of BCI."
