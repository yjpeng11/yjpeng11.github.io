abstract: “The last few decades have witnessed a revolution in the field of mental health, brought about by state-of-the-art techniques of artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we review the evidence for the systematic application of AI for the detection and intervention of stress-related mental health problems. We first explore the potential application of AI in stress detection and screening through advanced computational techniques of machine learning algorithms that analyze biomarkers of stress and anxiety. Building on the accurate detection of mental health problems, we further review the evidence for AI-based stress interventions and propose the promising prospect of applying decoded neurofeedback as a personalized resilience-building intervention. Together, the current review assesses the effectiveness and major challenges of AI technologies in real-world applications and demonstrates the transforming impact of AI on the field of mental health.”
