abstract: "Threat learning processes are thought to be foundational to anxiety and fear-related disorders. However, the study of these processes in the human brain has largely focused on specific brain regions, owing partly to the ease of translating between these regions in human and nonhuman animals. Moving beyond analyzing focal regions of interest to whole-brain dynamics and connectivity during threat learning is essential for understanding the neuropathology of fear-related disorders in humans. In this study, 223 participants completed a 2-day Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm while undergoing fMRI. Participants completed threat acquisition and extinction. Extinction recall was assessed 48 hours later. Using a data-driven group independent component analysis (ICA), we examined large-scale functional connectivity networks during each phase of threat learning. Connectivity networks were tested to see how they responded to conditioned stimuli during early and late phases of threat acquisition and extinction as well as during early trials of extinction recall. A network overlapping with the default mode network involving hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and posterior cingulate was implicated in threat acquisition and extinction. Another network overlapping with the salience network involving dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), mPFC, and inferior frontal gyrus was implicated both in threat acquisition and in extinction recall. Other networks overlapping with parts of the salience, somatomotor, visual, and frontoparietal networks were involved in the acquisition or in the extinction of learned threat responses. These findings help support the functional cooperation of specific brain regions during threat learning in a model-free fashion while introducing new findings of spatially independent functional connectivity networks during threat and safety learning. Rather than being a single process in a core network of regions, threat learning involves multiple brain networks operating in parallel performing different functions at different timescales. Understanding the nature and interplay of these dynamics will be critical for comprehensive understanding of the multiple processes that may be at play in the neuropathology of anxiety and fear-related disorders.
