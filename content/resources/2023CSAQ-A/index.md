Objective: To test the validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the Social Anxiety Questionnaires-Adults (CSAQ-A). 

Methods: Totally 555 participants [aged 18 to 60 years, average age (29 ± 8) years old] were recruited to complete the CSAQ-A. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE) and several questionnaires related to anxiety and depression were conducted to test the criterion validity. After 4 weeks,143 subjects were retested. 

Results: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the five-dimensional structure of the CSAQ-A exhibited excellent fit indices. The CSAQ-A scores showed positive correlations with the LSAS, BFNE and other measurements of anxiety and depression (ICC=0.395-0.668, Ps<0.001). The internal consistency of the scale was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96), and the test-retest reliability was acceptable (0.80). 

Conclusion: The Chinese version of the Social Anxiety Questionnaire-Adults has good validity and reliability and can effectively evaluate social anxiety in the Chinese adult population.
