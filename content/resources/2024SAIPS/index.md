**Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS)**  

**Introduction:** We developed the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS), based on a generative multimodal artificial intelligence model. The system contains 279 social scenario images and 118 control images, generated using AI tools such as Stable Diffusion-XL and DALL-E 2. The pictures were generated along three theoretical dimensions grounded in existing theories related to social anxiety:  

1. **Emotional Expression:** Pictures depict emotional expressions categorized as negative, neutral, or positive.  

2. **Social Dominance:** Pictures include scenarios with a dominant individual (i.e., one agent presenting a sense of being more important or stronger than other agents in the picture, or than the observer) or otherwise (e.g., peer-like relationships, or a single agent).  

3. **Eye Contact:** Some pictures involve direct eye contact between characters and the observer, while others do not.  

All pictures were uniformly resized to 1024×768 pixels to maintain consistency across the dataset.  

In addition, SAIPS includes five subjective ratings: Social Anxiety Rating (SAR), Valence, Arousal, Involvement, and Picture-Text Consistency. These ratings offer a more comprehensive analysis of how images influence individuals' psychological responses. The system also provides objective ratings, including image descriptions, scene characteristics, and the number of characters present, offering a multi-layered data set for research purposes.  

To explore specific response patterns to social scenarios, SAIPS includes 118 control images without people, which help enhance the system's accuracy in predicting social anxiety traits. SAIPS serves as a valuable resource for research on social anxiety, mental health, and the development of AI-based diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
