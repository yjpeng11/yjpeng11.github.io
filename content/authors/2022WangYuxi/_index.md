Yuxi is broadly interested in translating significant findings in neuroscience to clinical practice, to assist in building objective diagnostic and treatment strategies for anxiety and depression. To promote this process, my work exploits cognitive behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, computational modeling, and machine learning algorithms, intending to better understand the etiology and pathophysiology underlying anxiety and depression and quantify cognitive and neural dysfunction.
