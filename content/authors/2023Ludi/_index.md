# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Ludi received her M.S. in psychology at Beijing Normal University. Broadly, I am interested in the cognitive and neural mechanisms of anxiety and depression and exploring potential treatments. My work mainly concerns with the following aspects, (1) decoding the multi-modal biological signals of patients with anxiety and depression by computational modeling, and revealing the behavioral and physiological characteristics of anxiety and depression; (2) Adopting the social evaluation experiment to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms of anxiety and depression in social interactions. In addition, I am also interested in using VR and neurofeedback to diagnose and treat mental disorders.
