Hi, I'm Jamie. I love to observe people's behavior, emotion or interaction with others. And I came to realize that my real interest is psychology until 2018. Psychology helps people improve their life, either tinny stuffs or mental illness. In the future, I'll devote my time to be a compassionate and powerful counselor.
