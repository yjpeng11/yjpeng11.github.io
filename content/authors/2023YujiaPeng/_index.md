Before joining Peking University, I worked with Dr. Michelle Craske and Dr. Hakwan Lau as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research investigates the neural mechanisms associated to mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I received my Ph.D. from University of California, Los Angeles, studying Cognitive Neuroscience Psychology in Dr. Hongjing Lu's Computational Vision and Learning lab. My work focused on revealing mechanisms behind motion perception and action understanding using approaches including behavioral experiments, computational modeling and neuroimaging.​ During my undergraduate, I worked in Dr. Fang Fang's Vision and Neuroimaging lab and completed my BS in Psychology at Peking University, Beijing.
