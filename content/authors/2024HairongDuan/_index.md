Good day! I'm Harper~ Every time I see the social news and tragic events related to mental illness such as depression, I feel heartache and pity for these patients. Therefore, I want to combine the knowledge of biology and psychology to further explore the pathogenesis behind mental illness. I'll be happy to help answer any questions you might have.
